# BigData-Fall-2018
Repository for project in Big Data Analytics


DATA INSTRUCTIONS:
Upload your normalized data (meaning remove the marketing info) to the correct sub-file under data sources. Preferrably try to keep all file formats as .csv. 
Weather data will be under the weather folder when I have it completed. 

I don't care how you choose to upload the files but make sure you do not overwrite someone else's work. 

Thanks,

Madison
