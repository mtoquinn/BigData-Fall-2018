# BigData-Fall-2018
Repository for project in Big Data Analytics


DATA INSTRUCTIONS:
Upload your normalized data (meaning remove the marketing info) to the correct sub-file under data sources. Preferrably try to keep all file formats as .xlsx because we can always make these into .csv files. 
Weather data will be under the weather folder when I have it completed. 

I don't care how you choose to upload the files but make sure you do not overwrite someone else's work. 

Thanks,

Madison
